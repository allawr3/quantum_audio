# Quantum Noise Generator

A Python-based tool to generate white noise using quantum random numbers derived from the 9-qubit "9q-square-noisy-qvm" quantum virtual machine. The generated noise is saved as a 16-bit WAV audio file.

## Features
- Utilizes 9 qubits to generate random bits.
- Produces 10 seconds of white noise.
- Saves the noise as a high-quality WAV file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/quantum-noise-generator.git
   cd quantum-noise-generator
